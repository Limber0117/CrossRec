This folder contains the experimental results for both LibRec and CrossRec, in particular:

1. PrecisionRecall.ods: Pecision-recall scores for all 10 folds.
2. Results_k10.ods: Diversity and Novelty scores for the case k=10.
3. Results_k20.ods: Diversity and Novelty scores for the case k=20.
4. SuccessRate.pdf: Success rate scores for all cases.

The results for LibRec are obtained by running the original tool implemented in C#. We gratefully acknowledge the LibRec source code implementation supplied by Ferdian Thung and David Lo at the School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University.
